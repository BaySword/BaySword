####ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Sadettin

ðŸ§  **Python & AI developer in progress**  
I'm exploring the world of data science and artificial intelligence, working on diverse data projects to expand my skills.

ðŸ’¡ I love to learn, dive deep, and create meaningful insights.  
ðŸŒŸ I believe: Our dreams are limitless, and growth is a lifelong journey.

ðŸ”¨ Current focus:
- Python programming (from basics to advanced topics)
- Data analysis & visualization (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Fundamentals of machine learning (Scikit-learn)
- Project development using Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“ˆ Goals:
- Build meaningful projects with real-world datasets
- Specialize in AI & ML domains
- Contribute to open-source projects and share while learning

âœ¨ As someone who believes in imagination and lifelong learning, what I share here is just the beginning.  
I'm here to explore, learn, and grow â€” and hopefully, connect with others on the same path!
